# Orbits

This is an orbit simulator. It simulate and propagate the player around the orbit/hyperbola as well as fully calculating the orbital elements (eccentricity, semimajor axis, true anomaly, etc.) to ensure extreme percision and accuracy. Lots of online research was done to make this, especially on Wikipedia.
